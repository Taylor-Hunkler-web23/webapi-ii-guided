Routing Notes

What is the interface for a web api?

-URI, Unform Resource Identifier
-URL, Universe Resource Locator
-Endpoint, very related to a URI
-HTTP === Network protocol, a set of rules for communication

REST(ish)

-everything is a "resource"
-single URI per resource. ex: 'http://web23.com/channels', 'http://web23.com/users'
-use HTTP METHODS to perform operations on resources.
-hypermedia (at ths leverl we are fully restful)

|Non REST|REST|
